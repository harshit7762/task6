In this task I had tested many passwords using Password strength checker tool And I got different types of results from different types of password:-
password123->43% is score and comment is Very Weak 
Password123->75% is score and comment is Weak
Password6204->90% is score and comment is Very Strong
Password@6204->100% is score and comment is Very Strong
Pass@6204->92% is score and comment is very strong
1234567890->7% is score and comment is very weak

 Best Practices for Password
At least 12–16 characters long (the longer, the better).
A mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
No common words, phrases, or predictable patterns (e.g., “password”, “123456”).
Not based on personal information (name, birthdate, etc.).
Unique for each account, not reused.
Preferably not found in published breach lists.
Passphrases can be both memorable and secure: e.g., “SunsetsAreBeautiful2025!”.
If difficulty remembering, use a password manager.

Tips Learned
Longer passwords exponentially increase resistance to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
Avoiding common substitutions (“P@ssword!”) alone is not enough—attackers know these tricks.
Unique, random strings or passphrases are best.
Never reuse passwords, especially for sensitive accounts.
Update passwords periodically and use multifactor authentication when available.
Use password managers to generate and store strong passwords.

Common Password Attack Types
Brute Force Attack
Tries all possible combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols.
The longer and more complex the password, the higher the time required (years for random, long passwords vs seconds for short/simple ones).

Dictionary Attack
Uses lists of common passwords, dictionary words, popular names with numbers/symbols appended.
Even stylized dictionary words (“P@ssw0rd!”) are at risk since attackers use substitutions.

Hybrid & Credential Stuffing
Mixes dictionary and brute-force approaches (e.g., “Rover2020.” or “HealthNY!”).
Uses known leak data to try existing password-username combos (credential stuffing).

Summary: Password Complexity and Security
Complexity and length are the biggest factors in password security: the higher the number of character types (upper/lower/symbols/numbers) and overall length, the harder and slower it is to crack, especially by brute-force.
Randomness stymies both brute-force and dictionary attacks.
Avoiding personal or common information and patterns, and not reusing passwords, provides best protection.
Password managers and multi-factor authentication add crucial extra layers to your security defenses.
The ideal strong password uses all character types, is long and random, never reused, and preferably stored via a password manager. Testing with strength checkers can help identify weaknesses and improve your password habits.
